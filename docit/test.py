def my_function(arg1: int, arg2: int) -> float:
	
	"""
	Here is some documentation for this method that is definitely not useless but just has a really long description of
	what is does that spans over multiple lines.
	
	:param arg1: Here is information for arg1 that contains a lot of text that will probably also spill over onto
	multiple lines.
	:param arg2: This is another line that will be too long and will end up needing a line break so that it may continue
	onto the next line. 
	:return: And finally we have the return statement, but not unlike the others, this description is also very long and
	requires multiple lines to accommodate it.
